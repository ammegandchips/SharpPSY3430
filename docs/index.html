<h2>Course structure</h2>
<div id="thursday-3-hour-sessions" class="section level3">
<h3>Thursday 3 hour sessions</h3>
<p>Each week, the 3 hours timetabled on a Thursday will consist of a
mixture of lecture style delivery and class/group discussions and
activities about key aspects of that week’s topic. This will all be
in-person in seminar room A in the Living Systems Institute (LSI/Seminar
Room A), except the Fertility and Mental Health session in week 8, which
will be in-person in Lecture Theatre C in Streatham Court.</p>
</div>
<div id="outside-of-session-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Outside-of-session materials</h3>
<p>Each week there will be required and optional materials (reading,
videos, podcasts, and activities) for you to engage with for each
topic.</p>
<p><strong>Required pre-session material</strong> - I expect the
required reading/viewing/activities to be done prior to the Thursday
session, as aspects of the material will be discussed during class. You
should spend between 1.5 and 2 hours on this material before each
session. Bring materials and any notes along with you to the Thursday
session.</p>
<p><strong>Optional material</strong> - The optional/suggested reading
is a chance for you to not only consolidate the information from the
Thursday session, but to explore areas of the week’s topic that may not
necessarily be covered in the session. I encourage you to go beyond the
reading lists and read on aspects of the topic you are interested
in.</p>
<p>If there are things you would like to know more about and they are
not mentioned in the lecture or covered by the optional reading please
let me know! Feel free to share with your coursemates too, via the <a
href="https://padlet.com/gcsharp/g6zvweblf6czrju1">Padlet</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="reflection-tasks" class="section level3">
<h3>Reflection tasks</h3>
<p>Each week, outside of sessions, you are invited to reflect on what
you have learnt. Through reflecting, you will develop a more complete
understanding of the topics and how they fit together. Ultimately, this
will help in your coursework and exam essays.</p>
<p><strong>Padlet:</strong> You are invited to ask questions, leave
comments, and share relevant material on our PSY3430 padlet <a
href="https://padlet.com/gcsharp/g6zvweblf6czrju1">here.</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PhotoVoice:</strong> PhotoVoice is a qualitative research
method whereby participants are invited to take photos of their everyday
experiences and tell stories through their photos. In this course, we
will not be conducting any research, but you are invited to take photos
of things you see in your everyday lives that are relevant to women’s
mental health and the topics we cover. Periodically, we will take a look
at the photos as a group and reflect on how they are relevant to our
learning. You can share photos on Cluster, by signing up <a
href="https://cluster.co/i/5VBXQY3P">here.</a> (you can also share notes
to describe the photos).</p>
<p><strong>Revision Quiz:</strong> At this stage of your studies, you
will be very adept at revising materials for exams. Perhaps some of you
have found that writing questions and testing yourself is a useful way
to consolidate and check your understanding. You are invited to create
and share revision questions that can be used by the whole class to test
themselves. At the end of the course, we will hold a revision quiz using
your questions. You can add questions to the revision quiz <a

<h1>Assessments</h1>
<div id="coursework" class="section level2">
<h2>Coursework</h2>
<p>Your coursework takes the form of an essay and will comprise 40% of
the marks for the module.</p>
<p>The essay question is:</p>
<div class="warning"
style="padding:1.0em; background-color:seashell; color:#cd5b45">
<p>“Given your understanding of the biopsychosocial influences on
women’s mental health, consider the argument that postpartum depression
is predominantly caused by abrupt hormonal changes during and after
childbirth. In your answer, give brief explanations of the biological,
psychological, and social/environmental influences on women’s perinatal
mental health. Clearly state whether or not you think that postpartum
depression is predominantly caused by hormonal changes and explain the
reasoning for your judgement.”</p>
</div>
<p>More information about the essay question and marking criteria will
be given in Week 1 and is posted on the ELE page under the assessment
tile.</p>
<p>We will also be conducting a formative assessment activity in Week 5,
whereby you will work in groups to plan an essay with a similar title to
the one above.</p>
<p>The essay is due in Week 8, on Wednesday 8th March.</p>
<div id="essay-formatting" class="section level3">
<h3>Essay formatting</h3>

<div id="scientist-practitioner-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Scientist Practitioner Model</h2>
<p>This modue is based around the Scientist Practitioner Model (Shapiro,
2002). This means using science to inform clinical practice, and vice
versa. Clinical practice is therefore “scientifically-informed” or
“evidence-based”.</p>
<p>Where the scientific evidence base is not as developed as it could
be, we use the scientific approach to understand what strategies to use
in applied work and to investigate whether these approaches are useful
or not.</p>
<p>In practice, clinical psychologists may find themselves grappling
with what “scientifically informed practice” or “evidence based
practice” actually means. Too often, people find their passions, and
then find data that matches their viewpoints, no matter what the quality
of the data is, and often ignoring data that doesn’t substantiate their
view points. In this module, we will be developing the skills to resist
this temptation and to take a scientifically informed viewpoint.</p>
<p>You will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be willing to approach the world (and especially your own
viewpoints) with a constantly curious and critical viewpoint. It’s about
being willing to be wrong, and in fact, seeking out evidence that might
prove that you are!</li>
<li>Understand what constitutes “good” data and what constitutes less
“good” data and then apply those standards to the evidence you’re
working with.</li>
<li>Understand that “evidence informed practice” isn’t always just about
trial evidence, it’s also about experimental and epidemiological
evidence about core processes and mechanisms in human emotion and
behaviour that help to explain the mental health problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This class will adapt each of these principles to examine a
biopsychosocial view of women’s mental health.</p>
</div>
<div id="pedagogical-teaching-approach" class="section level2">
<h2>Pedagogical (Teaching) Approach</h2>
<p>This module aims not only to teach you core content, but also to help
you apply a lot of the critical thinking skills you have been learning
for the past 2+ years. Furthermore, it aims to help you consolidate,
synthesise and generalise this knowledge. Knowledge is useful when it
becomes relevant to you and when you can use it.</p>
<p>Teaching styles that have become ubiquitous on university campuses
often inadvertently promote passive learning. For example, text heavy
Power Point slides that can be downloaded prior to class and that guide
the learner through the topic in a structured fashion may help everyone
to feel secure that they have the material they need for the exam, but
these approaches are demonstrated to reduce actual long-term
learning.</p>
<p>Approaches that encourage the learner to organise the material for
themselves, to sort through what is and what isn’t important, to reflect
on the content, to manipulate knowledge, and to apply it are all
associated with longer-term and more effective learning. In addition,
there is a direct dose relationship between number of times a piece of
knowledge is presented and the likelihood that it will be retained in
memory and used in new circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore, to achieve the learning aims of this course, an <em>active
learning approach</em> will be taken. You will still have written
learning materials, but you will find these are only broad guides to
help organise the seminar structure and allow for flexibility. The
pedagogical strategies used in this module will be varied. Sometimes we
will focus primarily on lecture and discussions. Sometimes the class
will be organised around small group learning tasks, which we will then
share with the larger class.</p>
<div id="example-teaching-and-learning-activities"
class="section level3">
<h3>Example teaching and learning activities</h3>
<p>The teaching and learning activities that you engage with throughout
this module are designed to develop your skills in critical thinking,
synthesis of ideas, and (persuasive) communication. These skills will be
helpful for the assessments, but they are also transferrable skills that
can help in your life and work beyond university.</p>
<p>In all cases, you will find it useful to make notes and to contribute
to the discussions and group work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video lecture:</strong> a lecture recorded by me for you to
watch before coming to the Thursday session. These are usually designed
to give a broad overview of a topic or to explain a concept that will be
fundamental to your understanding of the topic.</li>
<li><strong>Scientific paper reading:</strong> a paper for you to read
and digest prior to coming to the Thursday session. You might be asked
just to read and try to understand, or to critically appraise the paper
(i.e. comment on its strengths and weaknesses).</li>
<li><strong>Online article reading:</strong> sometimes, you will be
asked to read online articles written by or for non-scientists. These
are sometimes useful for providing a general overview or a different
perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Online video:</strong> there are some brilliant videos
online that can provide clear, concise introductions to basic concepts.
Sometimes I will point you to these to watch before coming to a session.
There are also excellent videos online that can help you hear from and
consider different perspectives, including the perspectives of
patients.</li>
<li><strong>Group discussion:</strong> either in small groups or
sometimes as part of the whole class, I will guide a discussion around a
topic. It can help to talk through ideas as a group and listen to the
ideas and perspectives of others.</li>
<li><strong>Debate:</strong> you will be put into two (or more) groups
and asked to come up with an argument for or against a statement. The
groups will then take it in turns to present their arguments and respond
to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Research sandpit:</strong> emulating working in an
interdisciplinary research team, you will work in a group to design a
research study to address a specific research question.</li>
<li><strong>Group presentation:</strong> you will work in small groups
to research a topic, synthesise an argument or narrative and then
present to the rest of the class. This is excellent preparation for
essay writing. The presentation itself might take the form of a lecture,
poster or infographic.</li>
<li><strong>Quiz:</strong> quizzes can be useful for checking your
understanding of basic (fact-based) information. It can sometimes be a
confidence boost for the exam to know that you are retaining and can
recall this kind of information.</li>

<h1>Expectations for class behaviour</h1>
<div id="be-nice" class="section level3">
<h3>Be nice</h3>
<p>We are all adults and we will treat each other accordingly. Therefore
we can expect to work in an environment that supports mutual respect and
thoughtfulness. As a general rule, if you ever feel critical of another,
please try to put yourself in that person’s shoes for a moment. Use what
you learn from that to inform your perspective, and then act
accordingly. In all interactions (including with me), look for ways to
balance responsibility and to arrive at mutually beneficial, practical,
and solution-focused outcomes are typically the best way forwards. See
the advice on group work below.</p>
</div>
<div id="do-the-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Do the work</h3>
<p>Please engage with the pre-session materials before coming to the
Thursday sessions. Often, there will be group learning tasks where you
will need to build on the pre-session material in class. If you have not
looked at it, you will be letting your group down.</p>
<p>During the sessions, please try to contribute to the discussions. I
know that ‘group work’ and ‘presentations’ may sound like horrifying
experiences to some. I really do empathise, but you will get so much
more out of this module if you engage with these sessions. See the
advice on group work below.</p>
</div>
<div id="turn-up" class="section level3">
<h3>Turn up</h3>
<p>We do not require attendance, although we highly encourage it. This
is your investment and you will get as much out of it as you put into
it. Although you’ll get some written material, these are just intended
to support your learning, and the main content of what is taught will be
in the Thursday sessions. The readings and powerpoints will not be
enough to do well in the assessments for this module.</p>

<h2>Reading and making notes</h2>
<p>This video explains why it’s important to read scientific papers, how
they’re structured, and one approach to reading papers that you might
find useful:</p>
<center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3aaXOrlAyg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</center>
<p>Reading learning content with a goal is always more effective. Make
notes as you’re reading, and try to get a sense of the main
points/arguments of the article. What is this article trying to say? If
you had to explain the main point of the article in three sentences to a
non-psychology family member, what would you say?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Be able to critique the detail of the article.</strong>
Given the main points of the article, what evidence do the authors
present to support their argument/points? Is the evidence good evidence?
Why or why not? Sometimes it may be that the logic of leading to their
hypotheses are weak. Sometimes it may be that the
design/methods/statistics are weak and/or lacking. Sometimes their
conclusions may leave a lot of questions unanswered. Write down 2-3 main
critiques (these could be criticisms or praise) for the
article.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Synthesise!</strong> There are three primary synthesis
challenges in this module:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Synthesising links between the readings for <em>each topic</em>
(i.e., each week): Are there any common threads between the articles?
Does one article inform another article? (e.g., does an article about
effects of estradiol on depression inform findings from another article
about the link between menopause and mental health?) State 1 or 2 ways
that the articles inform each other.</li>
<li>Synthesising links between each reading and <em>the overall
course</em>: This is a course about women’s mental health, but not all
the articles will necessarily be directly about women’s mental health.
It doesn’t mean that it doesn’t pertain to women’s mental health, and
one of the challenges of the course will be applying material to women’s
mental health. For each article, state at least one way it pertains to
women’s mental health. OR, find a theme for the articles for the week
and state how that theme pertains to women’s mental health.</li>
<li>Synthesising links <em>between topics</em> (i.e. between weeks):
think about how the readings for each week pertain to topics from
previous weeks. Are there any links? Where you notice this, write it
down!</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="working-in-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Working in groups</h2>
<p>Everyone has a style. Our styles may be determined in part by our
thresholds and tolerance for anxiety/distress, our drive for and
experience of pleasure/reward, our inhibitory style/capability, our
preferences for routine or for novelty, amongst other things. For each
person, where we fall along these continua will be both a strength and a
weakness, depending on what the context/situation demands of an
individual at any given moment. Please keep that in mind. There is no
one way of being that is, at all times, superior to another way of
being.</p>
<div class="warning"
style="padding:1.0em; background-color:seashell; color:#cd5b45">
<details>
<summary>
<strong>Click to see an example</strong>
</summary>
<p>Being organised and getting things done quickly can be a real
strength. Sometimes individuals with these styles will describe feeling
a sense of pressure and some anxiety straight away when tasks are
provided. Thus, getting things done quickly, and having a good plan for
getting them done can help to relieve this pressure and anxiety, and can
also provide these individuals with a sense of accomplishment and
reward. All of these things are positives in many contexts. At the same
time, though, there are contexts where it is better to wait and get more
information, to sit and tolerate and accept uncertainty, to throw out
rule books and approach situations from novel perspectives. There are
also situations where there are many things to do, and it is not
possible to get everything done in a quick and timely fashion. These
individuals can struggle to meet the demands of those kinds of
situations and that can produce stress and anxiety for them.</p>
<p>Other individuals may have a style that has a high tolerance for
anxiety, openness to new experiences and sensitivity to reward. Those
individuals may be flexible to contextual demands, creative in their
thinking, and willing (and even excited) to take on challenges. Our
society (and science!) has certainly benefited from creative and novel
approaches and individuals who were willing to take chances and to dive
into uncharted territory. However, those individuals may not get tasks
done as quickly, because they may not feel the pressure and anxiety
needed to get tasks done until later, and they may not do things in a
straightforward, strategic fashion. This may cause them some
distress.</p>
</details>
</div>
<p><br> The point is, everyone has different kinds of skills that
contribute to their style, and for everyone, their style will be both a
strength and a weakness.</p>
<p>In this class, we will have group based activities. As you work on
these activities together, be aware of what your strengths are. Are you
good at creative thinking? Are you good at systematically finding good
research and references? Are you good at planning out clear responses?
Are you good at directing and managing a group in its tasks?</p>
<p>When working in your groups, let people know what your strengths are,
and try to stick with tasks that are better suited to your strengths.
Not everyone is a leader, and that’s okay. But also, leadership demands
can vary by context, so you may find that you are well suited for a
leadership role in one context but not another.</p>
<p>And always, be patient with your group members who are different from
you. Remember, we need every style in this world, and although you might
currently find yourself in a context where your strengths might shine,
there will be another where you will need your group member’s
strength.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you find yourself struggling on one of the tasks,
because it’s doesn’t meet your strength – hang in there. We all will
have this, and your moment too will come.</p>

<div id="wellbeing" class="section level1">
<h1>Wellbeing</h1>
<p>Sometimes in this class we will discuss trauma, mental health
problems, and other topics that may be sensitive to you. Sometimes it
will be clear that we will be discussing this ahead of time and you can
plan/prepare, but other times it will simply be part of the course
content, or may rise naturally as part of discussions.</p>
<p>If you are aware of certain topics ahead of time and you are
concerned that these may be difficult for you, I would encourage you to
speak to me about this and we can think of a plan to help you get the
course content you need whilst managing the sensitivities you might
have.</p>
<p>Also, I would encourage you, where and when you are comfortable doing
so – to:</p>
<p>A. Try to expose yourself in a safe and comfortable fashion to
distressing content (i.e., if your distress is above a 6 or 7 on a 0-10
scale, this may require additional steps being taken) B. Where
comfortable for you, discuss your feelings with safe and trusted friends
and family members. However, please be sure to talk to people who you
trust.</p>
