# ILOs for this week

At the end of this week, students should be able to...

- Compare females and males in terms of genetics, anatomy, hormones, brain structure/function, and fetal development.
- Describe the physiology of the menstrual cycle.
- Explain the physiological changes that occur at key reproductive life stages: puberty, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.
- Discuss hormonal effects on the brain

# What you need to do this week

- **Before** coming to the seminar:
    + Please make sure you have read/watched/listened to all the readings, videos and audio recordings below. You will find it useful to make notes.
    + Spend around one hour researching and making notes on the biological changes that take place around *puberty*, *pregnancy*, *breastfeeding*, and *menopause*. You will use the notes during the seminar in the group task.
    
- **During** the seminar, please:
    + Make the most out of your time by contributing to the discussions and listening to others.
    + Three to four people will be responsible for making notes each week. Please check the [rota](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w92ab1ntub6mytx/PSYM3430%20Note%20taking%20rota.docx?dl=0) to find out if it's your week.
    + This week there is a group task, which will be explained during the seminar. We will spend around 1 hour 15 mins on this.
    + We will also spend around 45 minutes on a whole-class discussion about the readings.
    
- **After** the seminar:
    + If you are a note-taker, please check the notes and make any additions or tidy them up if necessary. 
    + All class members should then check the notes and make any additions.
    + Note-takers should also add *revision questions* to the *revision quiz*.

## Menopause

### Guided discussion questions:

- How could physiological states, symptoms and changes affect mental health?
- To what extent can biological differences between the sexes account for differences in mental health?
