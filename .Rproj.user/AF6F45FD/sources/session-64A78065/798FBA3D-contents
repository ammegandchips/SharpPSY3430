## 1. Epigenetics & Epidemiology {.tabset}

### Introduction to EpiEpi 

This week, you will be introduced to epigenetics and why epigenetics might be of interest to epidemiologists.

There are two **videos**, each followed by a short **quiz** to check your understanding. 

You will then participate in a **live session**, which will give you an opportunity to ask any questions or bring up any points for discussion. You will also participate in some group work. You can save your questions for the live session, or you can post them anonymously on this [padlet](https://padlet.com/gs8094/5vvz4eu7dyyhpwx7).

By the end of this session, you will be able to...

*   Define epigenetics and explain classic examples from the literature
*   Explain why epigenetics is of interest to epidemiologists
*   Discuss the issues of confounding, bias and reverse causality in the context of epigenetic epidemiology
*   Explain how the epigenome can change over time

### Epigenetics

Epigenetics refers to mitotically-heritable biological phenomena that regulate the activity of the genome without affecting the underlying DNA sequence.

In other words, epigenetics refers to chemical modifications that provide a layer of information that works in combination with the base layer (the genome) to regulate gene function. This epigenetic information allows the DNA sequence of the genome (which is largely the same in every cell of an individual’s body) to perform differently in different contexts – switching genes on or off accordingly. 

Epigenetics achieves this without altering the DNA sequence in which our genes are encoded; instead it provides instructions for how the DNA should be interpreted. A crucial detail is that, to qualify as ‘epigenetic’, the epigenetic layer must be mitotically-heritable, i.e. it must be able to survive cell division (mitosis) and therefore have the potential to be replicated across generations of cells over time. This feature means that epigenetic information has the ability to have long-lasting influences on gene expression and subsequent functional effects on characteristics, health and disease.

The following video introduces the concept of epigenetics. It discusses what we mean by epigenetics, some classic examples of epigenetics in other species, and why epigenetics might be interesting to epidemiologists.

Even if you have a background in molecular biology, we recommend that you watch this introductory video so that you're aware of the definition of epigenetics we'll be using in the rest of this course.

### Epigenetics & epidemiology

Epigenetics offers one way to understand how the varied and complex environments we exist in can become embodied to affect our biology, including our health and risks of disease, disability and death.

The following video introduces how epidemiological approaches can help us to understand the role of epigenetics in health and disease.

### Live session

In the live session, you will work in small groups to produce some bullet points arguing why epidemiologists should be interested in epigenetics. You will also participate in a question and answer session where you will have a chance to ask questions about epigenetics and epidemiology. 

You can save your questions for the live session, or you can post them anonymously on this [padlet](https://padlet.com/gs8094/5vvz4eu7dyyhpwx7).

## 2. EWAS {.tabset}

### Introduction to EWAS

This week, you will learn about epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS).

There is one **video** intro to EWAS, followed by some reading to consolidate your learning about challenges in epigenetic epidemiology, and a **practical** to illustrate some of the ways we can explore EWAS results files.

You will then participate in a **live session** where you will learn about some examples of EWAS studies through group work. This session will also give you an opportunity to ask any questions about the online material or bring up any points for discussion. You can save any such questions for the live session, or you can post them (anonymously) on this [padlet](https://padlet.com/gs8094/5vvz4eu7dyyhpwx7).

By the end of this session, you will be able to...

*   Explain what an EWAS is
*   Explain the key steps involved in running an EWAS
*   Discuss the limitations of EWAS and how we can reduce these through study design and analytical approaches
*   Interpret examples of how to display EWAS results
*   Recall examples of EWAS 

### What is an EWAS?

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are the most commonly used analysis approach in epigenetic epidemiology. EWAS involve statistical tests being applied to each feature in a ‘genome-wide’ epigenetic dataset to assess the association between epigenetic features and a variable of interest. The term is most commonly used to describe studies of array-based (or increasingly, sequencing-based) DNA methylation datasets.

Watch the video below to learn more about EWAS and the key steps involved in running them.

![](https://youtu.be/r439YI7VcbI)


### EWAS study design and limitations

EWAS study design considerations and limitations outlined in the Introduction to Epigenetic Epidemiology video from week 1. Review that video now if you need to.

#### Study design

In principle, any study design used in epidemiology can be used to conduct an EWAS. 

![The following figure is taken from Epigenome-Wide Association Studies for Common Human Diseases by Rakyan et al., Nature Reviews Genetics, 2011](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrg3000/MediaObjects/41576_2011_Article_BFnrg3000_Fig1_HTML.jpg)

#### Challenges in epigenetic epidemiology: similarities with genetic epidemiology

The EWAS was borne from the GWAS, but fundamental differences between genetic and epigenetic measurements mean that approaches applied in genetic epidemiology cannot be simply applied to epigenetic epidemiology and their results interpreted in the same way.

```{r epigenetics3, echo=FALSE}
quiz(  
question("'Which of the following challenges apply to BOTH epigenetic AND genetic epidemiology? (select all that apply)",
    answer("Tissue specificity", correct = FALSE),
    answer("DNA quality", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Adequate sample size", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Multiple testing", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Reverse causation",correct = FALSE),
    answer("Studies usually conducted on people of white European ancestry", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = "Try again, at least some of your selections are wrong.",
    correct = "Correct!\n\nDNA quality, whether the sample size provides adequate sample size, and issues with multiple testing are issues that affect both genetic and epigenetic epidemiology. Both fields also suffer from a focus on samples largely comprised of people of white European ancestry, with a limited understanding of whether findings are generalisable to people with different ancestries.\n\nIssues of tissue specificity and reverse causation tend not to affect genetic studies.", 
    allow_retry=TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

#### Specific challenges in epigenetic epidemiology

The epigenome is a complex phenotypic trait, therefore there are specific challenges to the design, conduct and interpretation of epigenetic studies that are important to consider. Some of these are discussed in the Introduction to Epigenetic Epidemiology video from week 1:

*   Confounding and reverse causation   
*   Technical confounding 
*   Tissue specificity
*   Cellular heterogeneity
*   Confounding by genetics

The degree to which it is necessary to mitigate some of these challenges will depend largely on whether the research aims to identify causal associations (i.e. causal effects of exposures on epigenetics, and epigenetics as a causal determinant of disease) or correlated epigenetic markers to indicate past exposure or predict future disease (where causality is not important).

### Practical: interpreting EWAS results

In this practical, you are going to view and interpret results from an EWAS. You will learn how to:

*   Find the number of associations that surpass a P-value threshold
*   Interpret QQ and Manhattan plots of EWAS results
*   Draw a volcano plot of EWAS results
*   Look up gene functions for top hits

We are using methylation and phenotype data from this paper: 

[Tsaprouni et al. (2014) Cigarette smoking reduces DNA methylation levels at multiple genomic loci but the effect is partially reversible upon cessation. Epigenetics. 9(10):1382-96.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25424692)

This study used the 450k array to compare blood DNA methylation in smokers and non-smokers.

The following EWAS model has been run: 

*   DNA methylation ~ Smoking status + + CD4T cells + CD8T cells + B cells + NK cells + Granulocytes + Monocytes + bisulfite conversion batch

#### Load the EWAS results

As discussed in the Introduction to EWAS video, EWAS results tables commonly comprise:

*   Epigenetic feature identifiers (e.g. CpG IDs on Illumina arrays are in the format of a unique number prefixed by ‘cg’) 
*   Regression coefficients (effect estimates)
*   Coefficent standard errors
*   P-values 
*   P-values adjusted for multiple testing
*   Information about each CpG (e.g. chromosome, genomic coordinate, nearest gene, relation to CpG island)

#### Adjust for multiple testing and summarise the number of "hits"

We'll start by loading the EWAS results and taking a look at the first few rows:

```{r load_summary_stats, exercise=TRUE}

res <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/2spcfydm8tyz2oz/model2.csv?dl=1",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(res)

dim(res)

```

*Note that there are only 45,759 CpGs in this EWAS results file, rather than 450k+. This is to limit loading times for the purposes of this practical!*

Next, we'll calculate how many CpG sites show what looks like robust association with smoking, i.e. the number of CpGs surpassing a P-value threshold. *Remember the importance of adjusting for multiple testing*.

You'll see that we have most of the information we need in the results files, but we're missing P-values after adjustment for multiple testing, so let's generate those. We can generate both the FDR-adjusted p-value and the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value:

```{r adjust_MT, exercise=TRUE}

res$fdr_p <- p.adjust(res$p, method="fdr")
res$bonf_p <- p.adjust(res$p, method="bonferroni")

head(res)

```

Calculate the number of CpGs that surpass an unadjusted P-value of 0.05:
```{r P_005, exercise=TRUE}
length(res$p[res$p<0.05])
```

Now adjust the above code yourself to calculate the number of CpGs that surpass the 0.05 threshold AFTER adjustment for multiple testing, using both the Bonferroni and the FDR method:

```{r MT_005, exercise=TRUE}

# First run these lines again
res$fdr_p <- p.adjust(res$p, method="fdr")
res$bonf_p <- p.adjust(res$p, method="bonferroni")

# Then write your own code...



```


```{r epigenetics4, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
question_text("How many CpGs are associated with smoking with an FDR-adjusted P-value <0.05?",
    answer("1539", correct=T),
    allow_retry=TRUE),
question_text("How many CpGs are associated with smoking with a Bonferroni-adjusted P-value <0.05?",
    answer("129", correct=T),
    allow_retry=TRUE)
)
```

You can see that FDR-adjustment for multiple testing is less strict than Bonferroni-adjustment. 

#### Visualise results

**QQ plot**

We can use the R package `qqman` to draw QQ plots.

A quantile-quantile (QQ) plot shows the observed distribution of the p-values (y-axis) against the expected distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis of no association (y-axis). Deviations from the line suggest either true associations or spurious associations due to other factors. The inflation factor λ gives an estimate of systematic bias that needs to be corrected for. 

```{r QQ, exercise=TRUE}

library(qqman) # if you have not already installed qqman, you can do so using install.packages("qqman")

qq(res$p)

```

```{r epigenetics5, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
question(
  "The QQ plot shows...",
  answer("Substantial inflation of p-values", correct = TRUE),
  answer("No inflation of p-values", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = TRUE, correct = "Correct! The P-values are much smaller than would be expected given the null distribution. They come away from the null line very soon. This suggests either you've found many very robust associations... or substantial confounding at many CpGs."
))
```

**Manhattan plot**

We can use the R package `qqman` to draw Manhattan plots.

A Manhattan plot is a plot of -log10 p values (y-axis) against genomic location (x-axis). It allows us to quickly see if there are any loci that are associated with smoking, the size of the p value and the location on the genome. 

```{r Manhattan, exercise=TRUE}

library(qqman) # if you have not already installed qqman, you can do so using install.packages("qqman")

manhattan(x=res,
          p="p",
          chr="chromosome",
          bp="position",
          suggestiveline=-log10(max(res$p[p.adjust(res$p,method="fdr")<0.05])),
          genomewideline = -log10(max(res$p[p.adjust(res$p,method="bonferroni")<0.05]))
          )
```

```{r epigenetics6, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
question(
  "The blue line shows...",
  answer("The Bonferroni-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = FALSE),
  answer("The FDR-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE),
question(
    "The red line shows...",
  answer("The Bonferroni-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The FDR-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

**Volcano plots**

While the Manhattan plot lets us see which CpG sites have small associated p-values, we can use volcano plots to view p-values and **effect sizes** on the same plot.

We can draw a volcano plot using the commonly-used R package for plotting data, `ggplot2`.

*If you are feeling confident with R, you could try to work out exactly what this code is doing, but don't worry if you do not feel confident doing this - generating plots is not an important part of this unit! You just need to be able to interpret them* 

```{r Volcano, exercise=TRUE}

# Load library
library(ggplot2)

# make note of the FDR and Bonferroni-adjusted P-value thresholds:
fdr_threshold <- -log10(max(res$p[p.adjust(res$p,method="fdr")<0.05]))
bonf_threshold <- -log10(max(res$p[p.adjust(res$p,method="bonferroni")<0.05]))

# create the plot
res_plot <- ggplot(data=res, aes(x=coefficient, y=-log10(p))) +
  	geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=1.75, aes(colour=abs(coefficient)>0.05 & p<fdr_threshold)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = fdr_threshold,colour="blue") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = bonf_threshold,colour="red") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = -0.05,linetype="dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.05,linetype="dashed") +
  	scale_colour_manual(values=c("black","red"))+
    theme_classic()+
  	theme(legend.position="none",plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  	ggtitle("Methylation ~ Smoking")

res_plot

```

```{r epigenetics7, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
question(
  "The red points show CpGs that are associated with smoking...",
  answer("...with an FDR-adjusted P-value <0.05 and an effect size greater than 0.05 in either direction", correct = TRUE),
  answer("...with an FDR-adjusted P-value >0.05 and an effect size greater than 0.05 in either direction", correct = FALSE),
    answer("...with an unadjusted P-value <0.05 and an effect size greater than 0.05 in either direction", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE),
question(
    "The red line shows...",
  answer("The Bonferroni-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The FDR-adjusted P-value threshold", correct = FALSE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```

What general pattern do you observe between p-value and effect size?

#### Look up CpGs and compare models

Finally, we will take a look at which CpGs are most strongly associated (FDR-adjusted P<0.05 and effect size >5% in either direction) with smoking according to this EWAS.

```{r GetHits, exercise=TRUE}

# Select CpGs with FDR-adjusted P<0.05 and effect size >5%
hits <- res[which(abs(res$coefficient)>0.05 & p.adjust(res$p,method="fdr")<0.05),]

# Order hits by p-value, so the CpGs with the smallest p-values are at the top
hits[order(hits$p),]
```

Look up some of these CpGs in the [EWAS catalog](http://www.ewascatalog.org) to see if they have been reported by any other EWAS. 

*   What traits have they previously been associated with? 
*   Google the gene name of the CpG third from the top of your list of hits. Can we be confident that the association with smoking at this CpG would replicate in an independent dataset?

### Live session

In the live session, you will look at some examples of published EWAS and work in groups to extract key information about methods used.

This session will also give you an opportunity to ask any questions about the online material or bring up any points for discussion. You can save any such questions for the live session, or you can post them (anonymously) on this [padlet](https://padlet.com/gs8094/5vvz4eu7dyyhpwx7).

## 3. Critical appraisal {.tabset}

### Critical appraisal of the epigenetic epidemiological literature

This week, you will complete a structured critical appraisal of an EWAS paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506343. It is a **formative assessment** that allows you to practice the same skills you will use to complete your summative assessment. However, no marks will be awarded for this formative assessment and no individual feedback will be given. The design of the session allows you to assess your own performance and reflect on areas for improvement.

The paper includes Mendelian Randomization (MR), which you will learn about later in this Unit. MR is an epidemiological technique that can be used to strengthen causal inference. Since you have not learnt about MR yet, you are not expected to critically appraise this element of the paper.

Prior to the live session, you are asked to watch a **short video** and **read a paper** while completing a **set of questions** to help you critically appraise it.

You will then attend a **live session** where you will work in three small groups to complete three tasks. You will then present your group work to the wider group and reflect on the experience of reading and appraising this paper. 

The live session will also give you an opportunity to ask any questions about the online material or bring up any points for discussion. You can save any such questions for the live session, or you can post them (anonymously) on this [padlet](https://padlet.com/gs8094/5vvz4eu7dyyhpwx7).

### How to read a paper


Prior to the live session, please watch the following video:

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3aaXOrlAyg)

## 4. Extra material {.tabset}

### Extra material

The information in this section is designed to guide your further reading and provide extra context and information for those who are interested. You will not be expected to have read this information or completed any activities before any live session.

### Epigenetic inheritance

You will recall from video 1 that epigenetic factors are ‘heritable’. The word ‘heritable’ has its own definitional ambiguities that have compounded confusion around what epigenetics is. 

The intended meaning in this context is the faithful replication of epigenetic patterns from parent to daughter cells during cell division (mitosis and perhaps meiosis) associated with normal growth (e.g. skin cells dividing and replenishing). 

However, many have interpreted the term ‘heritable’ as referring to the passing of information between generations of individuals, from parent to child, introducing the idea that epigenetic variation acquired by a parent due to their life experiences may be transmitted to their offspring.

At this juncture, it is important to make clear the distinction between inter- and trans-generational epigenetic inheritance, which are terms often used interchangeably in the literature, but which are different phenomena. Both terms refer to the idea that epigenetic variation can be passed on to subsequent generations, but the proposed mechanism is quite different.

**Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance** refers to the passing of epigenetic variation from an exposed generation to one that was not exposed, as either an adult, a child, a fetus or even a germ cell within a developing embryo. Therefore, after an exposure, epigenetic variation must be traceable in the second generation (if the original exposed individual was male or a non-pregnant female) or third generation (if the original exposed individual was a pregnant female) to be considered truly “transgenerational”. The idea that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance might exist has captivated scientists, philosophers and the lay public alike. Some have argued that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is Lamarckian – i.e. that it supports the idea (inaccurately named after 19th century French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck) that an individual can pass the characteristics acquired through their life on to their offspring, with a lasting impact on evolution. 

**Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance** refers to the passing of epigenetic variation from one generation to the next through direct exposure, either to the individual while they are in utero, or to the germ cells from which the individual was conceived. *There is no requirement for this effect to persist in future generations.*

![From: Heard & Martienssen, 2014 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.045](https://marlin-prod.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/6d0f549e-eaf1-4fb7-bc79-a0fba08a2b69/gr1.jpg){width=400px}

There is a growing evidence linking maternal pregnancy exposures to variation in offspring DNA methylation, which supports the existence of intergenerational epigenetic effects (we will discuss this in more detail in the session on molecular epidemiological research in the IEU). 

In contrast, the existence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a contentious topic. Although transgenerational epigenetic inheritance appears to be relatively common in plants and can occur in animals such as nematodes, there is little evidence to support it occurring in humans, or indeed, any other mammal ([Heard and Martienssen, 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24679529/); [Perez and Lehner, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30602724/); [van Otterdijk and Michels, 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27037350/)). The phenomenon would require that the epigenetic variation evades the normal rounds of epigenetic erasure that occur in the early embryo and its germ line, which, based on current understanding of these mechanisms, makes it somewhat unfeasible in species that rely on the germline for reproduction. 

Although some studies appear to show evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in rodents, there is disagreement over the interpretation and replicability of their findings. Where observational studies in humans have found associations between an exposure in one generation and health outcomes in subsequent generations, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance has sometimes been suggested as the most plausible underlying mechanism. However, in addition to being open to confounding and other sources of bias, very few of these studies have actually explored, or indeed had the necessary data or biological samples to explore, epigenetic mechanisms. Those with epigenetic data (for example studies of offspring of parents exposed to the Dutch Hunger Winter led by Bas Heijmans at the University of Leiden) have so far only been able to demonstrate evidence suggesting intergenerational epigenetic inheritance – i.e. associations with epigenetic variation in offspring who were exposed in utero, either directly as a fetus or as a germ cell during their parent’s fetal development.

### Replication and validation

#### Replication

To minimise the chance of reporting false positives (spurious findings), researchers often attempt to replicate their EWAS findings **using the same approach and technology in an independent dataset**. Associations in the same direction and of a similar magnitude can help to strengthen confidence in findings.

Replicating findings often requires collaboration between different research groups. Several consortia have been established to facilitate collaboration between studies with comparable data. Consortia can coordinate meta-analysis of EWAS summary statistics across multiple independent studies, thus boosting sample size and power to detect smaller effects.

For example, the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium [Felix et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29025028/) was set up to help coordinate multicohort studies of epigenetic data in relation to maternal (and paternal) exposures during pregnancy and exposures and outcomes in childhood.

#### Validation

To mitigate the effects of measurement error in methylation data, technical validation is performed on the same samples but using a different technology.

The following figure shows various methods for measuring DNA methylation, which could be used to validate findings from an Illumina array. Ideally, validation methods should belong to a different category from the original method. In practice though, findings from the Illumina array are usually validated using pyrosequencing, which is also a bisulfite-based strategy.

### Practical: epigenetic age acceleration

If you have time and are interested, you may want to complete this practical activity.

It will help you learn/improve your R skills and enables you to explore a variable derived from epigenetic data: age acceleration.

Thanks and credit for the original design of this practical goes to Paul Yousefi and Andrew Simpkin.

#### By the end of this practical, you will be able to...

a.	Draw a scatterplot to compare DNA methylation age with actual age
b.	Estimate the correlation between DNA methylation age and actual age
c.	Perform linear regression to obtain age acceleration residuals
d.	Assess whether smoking is related to age acceleration

#### Introduction
We begin this practical having used the online calculator/predictor of DNA methylation age (freely available [here](http://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu)) to predict methylation age for individuals who took part in this study:

*[Tsaprouni et al. (2014) Cigarette smoking reduces DNA methylation levels at multiple genomic loci but the effect is partially reversible upon cessation. Epigenetics. 9(10):1382-96](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25424692)*

There are two sets of data you'll need for this practical, `traits` and `pred.ages`. Both have been pre-loaded in this workbook, but if you want to explore the data outside of this tutorial, they are stored in a Dropbox folder [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d76shp9yfya8uvp/AADb245inIdByBTd28H9uiXma?dl=0) (note that `pred.ages` is stored as a file called `methylation_ages.csv`).

*    `traits` is a data frame of phenotype data for each sample. The first column (`SampleID`) uniquely identifies each sample.
*    `pred.ages` is a column of DNA methylation predicted ages for the same individuals as have data in the traits data frame.

In this practical we will open the result from the online calculator, compare the predicted DNA methylation ages with the actual age for each individual using a scatterplot and estimate the correlation between the predicted and actual age. In part 2, we use linear regression to obtain age acceleration residuals (these tell us whether individuals are ahead or behind their epigenetic clock) for each individual and then test whether smoking is related to age acceleration.

#### Loading and exploring the data

You should be able to run this practical within this tutorial. Alternatively, you can open R on your computer and type the code directly into the console.

We will now load the results from the online calculator and the data containing the traits of the individuals. Both of these are saved in comma separated files, or csv files. These can be opened and viewed in Excel but also read straight into R using the read.csv() function. 

Run the two lines below, then use the `ls()` and `head()` functions to check that you have successfully loaded the data and that the data look as you would expect.

```{r load_data, exercise=TRUE}
traits <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdwz3spu9v13jj3/traits.csv?dl=1",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pred.ages <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/452qf2bfop8ahon/methylation_ages.csv?dl=1",header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ls()
head(traits)
head(pred.ages)
```

In the box below, use the `summary()` and `str()` functions to further explore the data.

```{r explore_data1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
```

To explore the relationship between two variables we can plot and/or find correlation as follows:

```{r correlate_data, exercise=TRUE}
plot(traits$age, traits$gender)
cor(traits$age, traits$gender)
```

We now merge these two datasets to make life easier. This can be done using the `merge()` function. To this function, we provide the two datasets to be merged (`traits` and `pred.ages`) along with the variable name used to match individuals (this is the identifier variable `SampleID` in this example):

```{r merge_data, exercise=TRUE}
data.merged <- merge(traits, pred.ages, by = "SampleID")
```

Now use the `head()`, `names()`, `str()` and `summary()` functions to explore the merged dataset `data.merged`
```{r explore_data2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
```

Using the output from your code above, fill in the following to one decimal place:

```{r text_box_quiz1, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
question_text(
  "Mean predicted age",
  answer("55.3", correct = TRUE),
  answer("55.31", message = "Remember we only need one decimal place"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "Median predicted age",
  answer("55.4", correct = TRUE),
  answer("55.39", message = "Remember we only need one decimal place"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "Mean actual age",
  answer("55.4", correct = TRUE),
  answer("55.39", message = "Remember we only need one decimal place"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "Median actual age",
  answer("56.0", correct = TRUE),
  answer("56.00", message = "Remember we only need one decimal place"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)

```

How do these compare?

Now use the `plot()` function to plot the predicted and actual ages in a scatterplot. You can add a line of equality by typing `abline(a=0, b=1)` on the line below you call your plot. 
```{r plot_data_scatter, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
```

```{r age_quiz1, echo = FALSE}
  question("What can we say about the points above and below the line?",
    answer("Points above the line show people who have a DNA methylation predicted age that is younger than their actual age"),
    answer("Points above the line show people who have a DNA methylation predicted age that is older than their actual age",correct=TRUE),
    answer("Points below the line show people who have a DNA methylation predicted age that is older than their actual age"),
    answer("Points below the line show people who have a DNA methylation predicted age that is younger than their actual age",correct=TRUE),
    allow_retry=TRUE,random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
```

Now use the `cor()` function to find the correlation between predicted and actual age.
```{r cor_data, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
```

```{r text_box_quiz2, echo = FALSE}
question_text(
  "What is the correlation rounded to two decimal places?",
  answer("0.76", correct = TRUE),
  answer("0.7", message = "Remember we need two decimal places"),
  answer("0.75", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places"),
  answer("0.758", message = "Remember we need two decimal places"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

#### Calculating age acceleration and relating it to smoking

Although the DNA methylation predicted ages are close to the actual ages in this sample, there are some individuals who are either younger or older than what was predicted. The idea of being ahead or behind your epigenetic clock has been called age acceleration. This is measured for each individual by getting the residuals (differences between the points and the fitted line) from a linear regression of DNA methylation age on actual age.

To carry out a linear regression in R, we use the lm() function.

```{r first_model, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
lm(DNAmAge ~ age, data=data.merged)
```

This just displays the result. We need to save those results into a new object (that we'll call `model`). Use the `names()` function to see what `model` contains:
```{r explore_model, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
model <- lm(DNAmAge ~ age, data=data.merged)


```

The object model now contains all the results from the linear regression of DNA methylation age on actual age. The residuals from this model tell us whether a person’s predicted age is younger than their actual age (negative residual) or older than their actual age (positive residual). The residuals are stored as `model$residuals`. We can store the residuals under a new variable, which we can join to our main dataset using the top three lines below. Use `head()` to check that this has worked. Then use `summary()` to summarise the age acceleration residuals.
```{r merge_residuals, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
model <- lm(DNAmAge ~ age, data=data.merged)
age.accel 	<- model$residuals
data.merged <- cbind(data.merged, age.accel)

```

Age acceleration (being biologically older than expected) and deceleration (being biologically younger than expected) has been linked to a wide variety of exposures and health outcomes. Let's see if it is related to smoking - i.e. do smokers tend to be biologically older/younger than non-smokers?

First, calculate age acceleration and add it to your data set (as above). Then add the code to conduct a linear regression of age acceleration on smoking using the `lm()` function. Store the model results as `model_smoking` and then use `summary(model_smoking)` to see all the key information. Use `confint()` to calculate the 95% confidence interval around your regression estimates.
```{r smoking_model, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
model <- lm(DNAmAge ~ age, data=data.merged)
age.accel 	<- model$residuals
data.merged <- cbind(data.merged, age.accel)


```

```{r text_box_quiz3, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
question_text(
  "What is the average difference in age acceleration between smokers and non-smokers? (round your answer to two decimal places)",
  answer("0.33", correct = TRUE),
  answer("0.3", message = "Remember we need two decimal places"),
  answer("0.32", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places"),
  answer("0.3253", message = "Remember we need two decimal places"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "What is the lower 95% confidence interval (round your answer to two decimal places)",
  answer("-0.52", correct = TRUE),
  answer("0.52", message = "Remember the sign (positive or negative)"),
  answer("-0.5222564", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places"),
  answer("0.5222564", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places and the sign must be correct"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
),
question_text(
  "What is the upper 95% confidence interval (round your answer to two decimal places)",
  answer("1.17", correct = TRUE),
  answer("-1.17", message = "Remember the sign (positive or negative)"),
  answer("1.1728465", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places"),
  answer("-1.1728465", message = "Remember we need the answer rounded to two decimal places and the sign must be correct"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
)
```

What does this tell you about any effect of smoking on age acceleration? Does this result surprise you at all?
