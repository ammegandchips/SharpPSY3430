# **Welcome to PSY3430!**

This third year seminar module is led by [Dr Gemma Sharp](https://gemmasharp.uk). All the learning materials are available on this website, grouped by week. For information about how the module is taught and assessed, see the module [handbook tab](Handbook.html).

I hope you enjoy the next few weeks learning about women's mental health!
