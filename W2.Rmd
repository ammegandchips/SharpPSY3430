# ILOs for this week

At the end of this week, students should be able to...

- Compare females and males in terms of genetics, anatomy hormones, brain structure/function, and fetal development.
- Describe the physiology of the menstrual cycle.
- Explain the physiological changes that occur at key reproductive life stages: puberty, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.

# What you need to do this week

- **Before** coming to the seminars, please make sure you have read/watched/listened to all the readings, videos and audio recordings below.
- **During** the seminars, please:
    + Make the most out of your time by contributing to the discussions and listening to others.
    + Three to four people will be responsible for making notes each week. Please check the [rota](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w92ab1ntub6mytx/PSYM3430%20Note%20taking%20rota.docx?dl=0) to find out if it's your week.
    + This week there is a group task, which will be explained during the seminar.
-**After** the seminars, if you are a note-taker, please check the notes and make any additions or tidy them up if necessary. All class members should then check the notes and make any additions. Note-takers should also add *revision questions* to the *revision quiz*.
