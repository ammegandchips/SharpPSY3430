### Guided discussion questions:

-   Why are we beginning a module about women's mental health with a discussion about sex and gender?
-   What language will we use throughout this module?
-   How can we discuss difficult or contentious issues openly, while accepting and respecting differences of opinion?
-   How can we explore and challenge the views of others in an intelligent, kind and sensitive way?

# Definitions of mental health and wellbeing

The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mental health as follows:

::: {.warning style="padding:1.0em; background-color:seashell; color:#cd5b45"}
Mental health is an integral and essential component of health. The WHO constitution states: "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." An important implication of this definition is that mental health is more than just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.

Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.

Mental health is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote, interact with each other, earn a living and enjoy life. On this basis, the promotion, protection and restoration of mental health can be regarded as a vital concern of individuals, communities and societies throughout the world.
